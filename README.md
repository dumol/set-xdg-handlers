# set-xdg-handlers
Bash script to configure automatically setting the handlers for file types
using the desktop files of installed apps.

This is used to automatically configure the order of file associations.
If you are tired of manually configuring what application should open by default
some file types, you can use this script to set your preferences quickly
and in a reproducible way.

See the examples in the Bash scripts for ways to configure this.
